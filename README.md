## General Introduction

The refusal of vaccination has emerged as a trend in recent years due to the fear for it to be cause of auto immune diseases. Public health officers are concerned with this attitude increasing the risk of the return of diseases which were considered almost estinguished. An example is the recent outbreak of measles in Switzerland. Currently, campaigns are promoting vaccination to contrast this new trend. I model the risk of a large spread of a disease given the percentage of non vaccinated people and visualize it by means of a simualtion. The former should define a safe threshold on the percentage of vaccinated people for the disease not to take over. Furthermore, we simulate to which extend a campaign should intervene to restore such threshold. 

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

Independent variables:
- percentage of non vaccinated people (look at current distribution)
- spread factor of the disease (known/dependendt given the disease)
- persuasion factor of campaign ( hyperparamether )
- persuasion factor among individuals ( to be defined )
- incidence of severe complications ( known/dependent on disease)

Dependent variable:
- damage in terms of number of severe complications per unit of time

I assume the society under study is subject to risk of infection only because of the lack of vaccination.
I also assume the vaccination is free of charge.
Such a model is therefore applicable to welfare states where the cost of a vaccination can be assumed inexistent.


(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

What can be considered a safe threshold on the ratio of non vaccinated people, given the disease and the society under study?
How much effort shall be invested in vaccination campaigns given the refusal trend?


(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results


I expect a minor percentage of people refusing vaccination to be of no harm for the entire society.
Also, I expect a sufficiently high percentage can lead to disastrous scenarios 

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
